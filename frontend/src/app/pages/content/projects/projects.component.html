                The script utlised BlockNative's memepool explorer to get real time transactions on the Ethereum Mainnet. This data was then passed through my own filter, where an algorithm I made determined the profitability of the trade. Afterwhich, the script interacted
                with the UNISWAP/SDK to automatically make the transaction.

                The current site you are on is my website that I built solely from Angular. I wanted the website to have a great interactive UI, including some more complex features to display my abilities with the Angular framework.
                <br>I am still working on improving my skills with working with Angular, however, I am confident that as my skills grow I will be able to further develop my website into what I envision.
