                The script utlised BlockNative's memepool explorer to get real time transactions on the Ethereum Mainnet. This data was then passed through my own filter, where an algorithm I made determined the profitability of the trade. Afterwhich, the script interacted
                with the UNISWAP/SDK to automatically make the transaction.

                This was a school assigned project where as a team of 9 we would work in an agile setting to develope a method to anchor files onto the blockchain. My contribution to the task involved building out the routes for the frontend to communicate to thee backend, as well as creating the anchoring process on the backend. <br>
                <br>
                For this project, I finally gained experience working in an agile setting and using offical tools like JIRA for project management.
