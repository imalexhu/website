                        PAC digital has a software called UNIDO which is a cryptocurrency wallet,
                        and it has decided to start suppoint new tokens like Ripple and Binance.
                        I was onboarded to handle this task. I was able to build out a full microservice
                        handling this task with end to end testing.
                        <br><br>

                        Upon finishin the ripple componenet, I moved on to building out an automatic
                        acount balance update service for all binnace wallets. Including BEP-20 tokens.

                        As a group of 9 students we were given a software engineering assignment by Trust Provenance.
                        The project was centered around storing encrypted hashes of legal documents onto a blockchain.
                        This allowed the hashes to be obtained later onwards to check for tampering in the original
                        document.
                        <br><br>
                        My role in this project was centered around building the architecture of the program. I built
                        out all the routes,
                        and the connections to the database. Following this, I was the person who directly interacted
                        with the libraries
                        from the block chain. I played a critcal role in my teams success and ability to achieve higly
                        in the final assessment.
                        <br>
                        Additionally, I was also tasked with implimenting a Merkle Hash Tree to significantly reduce the
                        size of our stored data.

                        Ran multiple Ecommerce stores. During this time I was able to learn a lot about marketing,
                        specifically how to use advertising platforms like Google Adwords and Facebook Business Manager.

                        During this period, I was able to profitably spend 32,000 dollars in adspend with an average
