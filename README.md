# website

This was a personal website developed by Alex Hu. There were some features that I wasnt able to produce. In the landing component I wanted there to be an animation, however I could not get the paths to function in a manner that would allow it. 

Some changes I will make when developing this project in the future is to have a clearer idea in mind. Especially when desiging the html. This would allow me to structure my documents better and make the code simpler.

Furthermore, had i created some general classes in the style.scss I could have reduced a lot of repeat and redundant code. This all goes back to the planning phase before the coding begins.

Idealy in the future I would like to build my website with dynamic resizing so that it provides a good viewing experinece on all platforms. The issue was with the side-nav bar that I wanted to do, it was too challanging for me to pull of with my skill level. 

Hopefully as I keep imporving I would be able to eventually make this website exactly how I envisioned it.
